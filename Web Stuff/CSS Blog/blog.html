	<h2>This is my first blog post!</h2>

	<p class="bar">Hey everyone! So this is the blog that I made as one of the micro projects while doing
	Colt Steel's Web Development Bootcamp. I know it's not that good, but hey - every expert was once a
	beginner! With that thought in my mind I had begun my journey to learn full stack web development.</p>

	<p>Let me give a brief overview of myself. I am Atharva Kulkarni, a Sophomore at IIT Bhubaneswar,
	and my major is Electrical Engineering. I am an active member of the programming and astronomy societies,
	and have participated in many major competitions, namely ACM ICPC (couln't clear the regionals but we did good!),
	Inter IIT Tech Meet 2018 and NSSC 2018. My current CGPA is 8.76.</p>

	<p>I have a huge interest in Computer Science!</p>

	<p>Here, check out my Image Gallery. It contains photos of the campus that I have taken so far.</p>
